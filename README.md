# movie_picker
Python code to pick a random movie from an excel sheet.
I was driven to code this because my watchlist on letterboxd had over 150 movies
and I was always indecisive on what to watch. Therefore I downloaded my watchlist
as a .csv file and made a list of all my movies. I then suggested a random movie 
from this list. This has given me an understanding of working with .csv files.
I later want to ensure this program can work with different file formats such as
.xlms or .json
